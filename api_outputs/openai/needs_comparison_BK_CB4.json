  "narrative_comparison": {
    "policy_changes": "Across the three years the core policy priority stayed anchored in housing but new external pressures emerged and were elevated. In FY2024 the report emphasized citywide priorities and process transparency: \"community boards again selected affordable housing as the most pressing issue citywide, followed by crime and public safety, and parks and open space.\" By FY2025 the board added and foregrounded operational crises that affect service delivery, stating explicitly that \"The current migrant crisis not only poses a long-term impact to the city's budget, it affects local service delivery and the overall quality of life.\" That new focus persists in FY2026, where the language shifts slightly but keeps the same emphasis: \"The migrant crisis not only poses a long-term impact on the city's budget, it also affects local service delivery and the overall quality of life.\"\n\nOther policy emphases also shifted: FY2024 highlighted improving process transparency and agency engagement (DCP noted \"we are publishing agency responses to these requests in the final section of these reports\" and committed to \"connect boards with agencies to advance budget request proposals\"). In FY2025 and FY2026, the policy frame broadened to include climate impacts (\"Frequent weather events and flooding\" appears in FY2025 and is repeated in FY2026) and explicit critiques and then partial rehabilitation of agency engagement (see Agency Response Evolution below). Overall, housing remained constant from FY2024 through FY2026 while migration and flooding rose from absent/not-emphasized in FY2024 to prominent policy concerns in FY2025 and FY2026.",
    "agency_response_evolution": "The tone toward city agencies evolves from DCP-led facilitation in FY2024 to frustration in FY2025 and then to a more conciliatory/thankful tone in FY2026. In FY2024 the DCP director emphasized improving transparency and agency engagement, writing that \"we are publishing agency responses to these requests in the final section of these reports\" and committing to \"connect boards with agencies to advance budget request proposals.\" In FY2025 the report is more critical of agency engagement, stating that \"Agencies with priorities largely governed by the current Mayoral administration have an opportunity to elevate community goals and further build constructive relationships. However, many remain absent or have had a diminished presence since the half-decade community planning process stalled in early 2019.\" By FY2026 the wording shifts to appreciation: the board states \"We are thankful for our city agency partners for their support,\" which signals a softer, more collaborative relationship or at least an attempt to present one publicly. This sequence suggests initial institutional support from planning (FY24), a period of perceived agency absence or disconnect (FY25), and a recovery toward positive working relationships (FY26).",
    "emphasis_shifts": "Some themes strengthened between 2024 and 2026 while others faded. Affordable housing remained a central theme in all years (FY2024: \"community boards again selected affordable housing as the most pressing issue citywide...\"; FY2025: list begins with \"Affordable housing\"; FY2026 continues housing in its core areas). New emphases that were absent or not prominent in FY2024 surfaced in FY2025 and persisted in FY2026: the migrant crisis (FY2025: \"The current migrant crisis...\"; FY2026: \"The migrant crisis...\"), and climate-related flooding concerns (FY2025: \"Frequent weather events and flooding\"; FY2026 repeats \"Frequent weather events and flooding\"). By contrast, FY2024's heavy framing around process transparency and publishing agency responses (\"we are publishing agency responses to these requests...\") is less prominent in the later documents, which instead foreground neighborhood-level operational impacts (migrants, flooding) and board outreach. The persistent mention of the lingering effects of COVID appears across the years, but it becomes one factor among several (housing, migration, flooding) by FY2026 rather than the main contextual frame in FY2024.",
    "structural_changes": "Document format and framing shifted from a Department of City Planning-forward presentation in FY2024 (opening includes a \"Letter from DCP Director Daniel Garodnick\" and process-focused language) to more board-centric and formally signed submissions by FY2026 (FY2026 begins with a dated letter to elected officials, lists board officers and contact information including bk04@cb.nyc.gov, and opens with \"Dear Community,\"). FY2025 shows an intermediate state (still formal but less of the DCP director's letter). FY2026 also displays a slightly expanded formal header and local contact details and a clear list of core areas, making the document read more like an authored product of the board rather than only the city planning office."

  ],
  "final_interpretation": "Over three years CB4's core commitment to affordable housing stayed constant while the report's focus broadened from procedural transparency (FY2024) to urgent operational crises—especially the migrant crisis and inland flooding (FY2025–FY2026). Agency engagement is portrayed as improving in rhetoric by FY2026 after a critical FY2025, and the document itself became more board-centered and formally packaged in FY2026."
