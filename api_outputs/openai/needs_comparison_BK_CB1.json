    "FY2024": "Emphasis on affordable housing as the top priority, with parks/open space and traffic/streets also called out as critical local needs.",
    "FY2025": "Reiterates affordable housing as primary while elevating transportation and mobility alongside parks with detailed service-level asks (Vision Zero, transit, park staffing).",
    "FY2026": "Maintains affordable housing, parks, and transportation as the three paramount challenges and adds a new, explicit focus on data transparency and accountability from city agencies."

  "narrative_comparison": {
    "policy_changes": "Across the three-year sequence the core priorities remained stable but the board's framing and additional policy asks evolved. In FY2024 the document framed needs around core quality-of-life items: \"Affordable housing continues to be our top priority, that must be addressed as our most cri\\u0000cal need,\" and noted parks and traffic concerns: \"Parks and open space are also cri\\u0000cal needs for our district\" and \"our streets are overburdened with traffic.\" By FY2025 those same areas are maintained but the board sharpened its transportation ask and linked it explicitly to infrastructure resiliency and programmatic solutions: \"Our top three priorities are Affordable housing, Parks and Open Space, and Transportation and Mobility,\" and the FY2025 text urges concrete actions such as a recommitment to Vision Zero and bus-route assessment: \"We ask the Department of Transporta\\u0000on to realize the Community Board One's goals for a recommitment to Vision Zero, reliable mass transit...\". By FY2026 the policy priorities remain the three constants, but the board expanded policy prescriptions and added a new policy area: data transparency and accountability. FY2026 states the housing situation with data citations and deeper anti-displacement framing: \"The affordable housing shortage continues to be our district's most pressing challenge\" and calls for \"Deeply affordable housing development... Preservation of existing affordable units... Anti-displacement programs.\" It also adds requests for standardized reporting: \"NYC Planning and other city agencies should: Establish standardized reporting frameworks... Provide regular, timely updates to community boards.\"",
    "agency_response_evolution": "The tone toward city agencies shifts from collaborative to more demanding over the three years. In FY2024 the report includes an affirming introductory note from DCP leadership emphasizing collaboration and transparency: \"DCP deeply values our partnership with community boards. We remain committed to supporting them...\" and notes that \"one of 28 City agencies responded\" to budget requests. In FY2025 the board continues to press agencies to act (see direct asks to DOT and DPR) but the text is more focused on operational requests (e.g., park staffing lists and transit service improvements: \"firm commitments to secure adequate, year-round recrea\\u0000on, security, and medical first aid staffing at McCarren Pool\"). By FY2026 the board's language indicates frustration with limited transparency and a call for accountability: \"Our ability to effectively advocate for and serve our community is hampered by insufficient data transparency from city agencies\" and the board explicitly asks agencies to \"establish standardized reporting frameworks\" and \"provide regular, timely updates to community boards.\" This indicates a shift from initially cooperative/partnering language (FY2024) to a more corrective/requirement-oriented stance (FY2026).",
    "emphasis_shifts": "Some themes strengthened while others were reframed. Affordable housing remained the anchor every year, but emphasis moved from general need (FY2024: \"Affordable housing continues to be our top priority\") to more granular concerns by FY2026: displacement pressure, inadequacy of the term \"affordable,\" and the need for \"deeply affordable housing development\" and \"anti-displacement programs.\" Transportation rose in specificity: FY2024 referenced overburdened streets, FY2025 made Transportation one of the \"top three priorities\" with explicit program asks (Vision Zero, busways, subway line overcrowding), and FY2026 continued that trend, adding specific transit lines and systemic impacts (\"Overcrowding on L and G train lines... Emergency vehicle response delays\"). Parks remained consistently emphasized (FY2024 \"Parks and open space are also cri\\u0000cal needs\"; FY2025 a detailed list of park maintenance and staffing needs; FY2026 escalated the urgency with \"unprecedented usage levels\" and calls for waterfront completion). New in FY2026 was a significant, explicit demand for \"Data Transparency and Accountability,\" including requests for demographic breakdowns and standardized dashboards — a theme not present in FY2024 and only emergent in tone in FY2025.",
    "structural_changes": "The documents keep the same overall organizational schema (intro, top three pressing issues, policy-area sections, budget requests), but FY2026 is more analytical and prescriptive in the topical narratives. FY2024 includes a DCP director's letter and an emphasis on publishing agency responses: \"we are publishing agency responses to these requests,\" whereas FY2025 is more operational with long, detailed lists of park- and transit-related needs. FY2026 expands the narrative sections (separate numbered headings for priorities, new \"Data Transparency and Accountability\" subsection), contains more bullet-style problem lists and explicit asks, and cites external data sources (e.g., \"NYC Planning's NYC Housing Production Snapshot 2023\"). Overall, FY2026 reads as more data-driven and programmatically specific compared with FY2024's shorter, partnership-oriented framing."

  ],
  "final_interpretation": "Over the three years Community Board 1 kept the same core priorities (affordable housing, parks/open space, and transportation) while moving from a collaborative framing with city agencies (FY2024) to more prescriptive and data-driven demands (FY2026). The big story is persistent pressure from development and population growth driving deeper emphasis on anti-displacement, operational service fixes (transit and parks staffing), and a new demand for agency transparency and standardized data to track outcomes."
