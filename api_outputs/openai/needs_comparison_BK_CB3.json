    "FY2024": "Emphasis on process transparency and citywide priorities with affordable housing, public safety, and parks highlighted, plus a DCP letter committing to improved CD Needs processes.",
    "FY2025": "Stronger focus on pandemic impacts, health access, and housing affordability/gentrification with stress on rent burden and scaling back of services.",
    "FY2026": "Shift toward concrete social-service needs — mental health, domestic violence prevention, elder services, youth engagement and violence reduction — along with updated neighborhood demographic framing."

  "narrative_comparison": {
    "policy_changes": "In FY2024 the document foregrounded citywide spending priorities and process improvements: as the DCP Director wrote, \"community boards again selected affordable housing as the most pressing issue citywide, followed by crime and public safety, and parks and open space,\" and committed to \"connect boards with agencies to advance budget request proposals, and to open the form earlier in the calendar year\". By FY2025 the narrative shifts from process commitments toward the direct effects of the pandemic and housing stress on residents: the FY2025 report emphasizes health access and housing insecurity, stating \"Access: The community was very hard hit by the pandemic including many deaths. We need sustained access to treatments (especially seasonal vaccinations) for COVID-19 and other emergent respiratory and contagious illnesses.\" By FY2026 policy language further pivots from process and broad priorities to explicit social-service demands: the FY2026 needs statement calls for concrete services — \"We need more robust mental health supports for residents of all ages, comprehensive domestic violence prevention, agile and easily accessible services for older adults, proven program and activities designed to engage and connect with youth, more resources for violence reduction and conflict resolution\" — signaling a move from identifying priorities to prescribing targeted programmatic interventions.\n\nOverall, the policy emphasis evolved from (1) FY2024’s emphasis on budget process transparency and reaffirming housing/public safety/parks as top issues, to (2) FY2025’s prioritization of pandemic recovery, health access, and housing affordability/ rent burden impacts, and then to (3) FY2026’s more granular social-service and violence-reduction asks. Specific priorities such as affordable housing remain present across the years, but FY2026 adds explicit new priorities (mental health, domestic violence prevention, elder and youth services) that were not as prominent in FY2024's framing.",
    "agency_response_evolution": "In FY2024 the report highlighted active agency engagement with the process and transparency: the DCP letter noted that \"for each, one of 28 City agencies responded to indicate whether the request could be accommodated within the upcoming annual budget\" and that DCP was committed to \"publishing agency responses.\" That language indicates a cooperative, process-oriented relationship with agencies. In FY2025 the tone shifts to indicate strains in service delivery: the FY2025 text states \"The stressors of the pandemic magnify the problems faced by vulnerable residents. The impacts of scaling back services and programs has negatively affected individual residents, families, and the community at large,\" implying that agencies or programs had reduced capacity or resources. By FY2026 the community's language is more prescriptive and corrective toward agencies — rather than celebrating responsiveness, the document issues direct programmatic demands such as needing \"more robust mental health supports\" and \"more resources for violence reduction,\" which suggests that agency responses up to FY2025 were perceived as insufficient and that the board expects deeper programmatic action rather than process improvements.",
    "emphasis_shifts": "Housing and gentrification are persistent themes across all three years but the data snapshots and emphasis evolve. In FY2024 the report referenced Census-era demographic change noting that \"the 2020 Census shows that the neighborhood’s population had grown by 44.5% to 174,960 since 2000 but the Black share of the population had fallen to 43.8%.\" FY2025 continued the gentrification framing with a slightly different timespan and numbers: \"by 2021, neighborhood’s population had grown by 22.9% to over 177,0000 since 2000 but the Black share of the population had fallen to 40.4%.\" FY2026 again updates the timeframe and statistics: \"By 2022, the district's population had grown by 14.4% to about 175,000 residents but the Black share of the population had fallen to 41.2%.\" These shifting figures show consistent attention to demographic change but also different reference years and metrics across documents. \n\nOther theme shifts: public health starts as a concern in FY2024 (DCP letter cites housing and safety), becomes pandemic- and access-focused in FY2025 with explicit calls for sustained access to COVID-19 treatments and vaccinations, and then broadens in FY2026 into mental health and social fabric repair — \"We need more robust mental health supports\" — along with explicit asks for domestic violence prevention and youth engagement. Parks and open space and public safety remain present but the later years emphasize programmatic social services and violence-reduction supports more strongly than the procedural or budget-transparency concerns that were prominent in FY2024.",
    "structural_changes": "The report format and front-matter changed subtly across years: FY2024 opened with a personal Letter from DCP Director Daniel Garodnick that discussed agency responses and process improvements; that letter is not present in the FY2025 or FY2026 extracts where the introduction is more standardized and procedural. The \"How to Use\" and Table of Contents structure remains consistent, but the form availability windows shift (FY2024 form July–November 2022; FY2025 June–November 2023; FY2026 June–November 2024). Contact and leadership information changed (FY2024 lists Chair Richard Flateau and District Manager Henry Butler; FY2026 lists Chair Anthony Buissereth and District Manager Nadeen Gayle), indicating an organizational change. FY2026 also shows minor formatting artifacts (e.g., UV/ZV/^V section markers) compared with earlier years."

  ],
  "final_interpretation": "Across 2024→2026 the Board's needs narrative moved from a process- and priority-setting stance (with DCP emphasizing transparency and agency response publication) toward urgent, programmatic service demands driven by pandemic aftereffects and deepening social needs. The big story is a transition from framing citywide priorities and process improvements to demanding targeted social services (mental health, domestic violence prevention, elder/youth supports and violence reduction) as agencies' prior responses were perceived as insufficient."
