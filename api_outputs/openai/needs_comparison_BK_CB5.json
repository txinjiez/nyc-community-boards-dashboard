    "FY2024": "FY2024 centers on presenting CD Needs with an emphasis on affordable housing as the top citywide issue and a DCP Director's letter highlighting transparency and agency responses.",
    "FY2025": "FY2025 continues the CD Needs framing while updating local accomplishments (library, playground, Gateway Center expansion) and leadership, maintaining emphasis on housing, jobs, and capital investments.",
    "FY2026": "FY2026 sharpens focus on large-scale development projects and industrial-business-zone interventions (new 4,000-unit projects, Vital Brooklyn/Alafia, IBZ Task Force), and appears more project- and implementation-oriented."
  },
  "narrative_comparison": {
    "policy_changes": "Across FY2024 → FY2026 the core policy priority of affordable housing remains consistent but the local policy framing shifts from general Citywide priorities to concrete large-scale development projects and implementation tools. In FY2024 the DCP director wrote that \"community boards again selected affordable housing as the most pressing issue citywide, followed by crime and public safety, and parks and open space.\" By FY2026 the narrative adds project-level detail: the document now describes \"the slated 4,000 units coming into the 42nd Council District with the New York State Vital Brooklyn, Alafia project, and the Innovative Urban Village development on the historic Christian Cultural Center site.\" This shows a move from naming top issues (FY2024) to naming specific development interventions (FY2026).\n\nOther policy emphases shifted toward economic development and industrial-zone remediation. FY2024 and FY2025 note retail expansion and community benefits (FY2025: Gateway Center Mall Phase II and CBA) but FY2026 elevates industrial-business-zone work into a formal policy-action frame: \"In 2023, the ENY IBZ Task Force was created...\" and the FY2026 text calls for increased focus on \"MWBEs within the parks as well as an increase in the local hire percentages.\" Thus the board’s priorities evolved from identifying capital projects and housing needs (FY2024) to explicitly naming workforce, MWBE, and IBZ strategies (FY2026).",
    "agency_response_evolution": "The tone about city agency engagement is more explicitly collaborative in FY2024 where the DCP Director (Daniel Garodnick) writes directly to readers: \"Through our online form, community boards generated more than 3,700 budget requests, and for each, one of 28 City agencies responded to indicate whether the request could be accommodated...\" That letter frames DCP as actively improving transparency and outreach: \"we are publishing agency responses...\" In FY2025 the introduction remains similar in structure and retains the collaborative, supportive framing of the CD Needs process (the FY2025 intro repeats the CD Needs purpose and how boards submit via an online form).\n\nBy FY2026 the explicit personalized agency voice (no DCP director letter) is absent and the introduction is more formal and standardized: it omits the DCP Director’s exhortation and the specific sentence about \"one of 28 City agencies responded\" found in FY2024. Instead FY2026 returns to a neutral, procedural description of the process and structure (e.g., \"This report represents the Statement...\" and guidance about the online form). That shift signals a change from an actively-promotional agency tone in FY2024 to a more procedural/neutral presentation by FY2026.",
    "emphasis_shifts": "Themes that grew stronger: large-scale development and implementation detail (FY2026 mentions \"the slated 4,000 units\" and names specific projects such as \"New York State Vital Brooklyn, Alafia project, and the Innovative Urban Village\"), and industrial/economic interventions (FY2026 highlights the creation of the \"ENY IBZ Task Force\" and the need for increased local hire/MWBE connection in IBZs). FY2024 emphasized citywide priorities with the DCP director calling out affordable housing, crime/public safety, and parks; FY2025 retains those themes but adds local project milestones (e.g., \"P.S. 938 opened its doors in the 2020-2021 school year\" and Gateway Center CBA results). By FY2026 the narrative strengthens the economic-development and implementation lens: \"The newly formed Task Force has made great progress in identifying root causes of crime, illegal dumping, and other activity in the IBZ, and securing funding for lighting and other initiatives...\"\n\nThemes that faded: the overt DCP leadership message and explicit mention of publishing agency responses appears in FY2024 but is not present in the FY2026 introduction. FY2024's opening advocacy from the DCP Director (a clear agency-facing encouragement) is absent in FY2026, which reads as a more standardized report template. New in 2026 that was not in 2024: named upcoming large residential developments (the 4,000 units and Vital Brooklyn/Alafia), and the formal creation and accomplishments of the ENY IBZ Task Force.",
    "structural_changes": "Format and organization stay broadly consistent (same table of contents and section breakdown across all years). Notable format differences: FY2024 includes a signed letter from DCP Director Daniel Garodnick with a conversational, agency-led framing; FY2025 drops that named director letter but preserves the narrative and similar content; FY2026 uses a more standardized template (with different section markers like \"UV\" and \"ZV\" in the text) and more updated board contact details (FY2024 lists Chair Andre T. Mitchell; FY2025 and FY2026 list Chair Alice Lowman and FY2026 shows an explicit District Manager email). The length and ordering of sections remain similar, but the diction moves from promotional/agency-engaged (FY2024) to procedural and project-specific (FY2026)."

  ],
  "final_interpretation": "Over three years BK5 moved from an FY2024 framing that emphasized citywide issue-priorities and agency transparency (with a named DCP director voice) toward FY2026's more project- and implementation-focused document that names major incoming housing developments and institutionalizes industrial-zone interventions (ENY IBZ Task Force). The big story is a shift from problem-identification and agency outreach toward concrete, large-scale development projects and targeted economic/IBZ actions."
