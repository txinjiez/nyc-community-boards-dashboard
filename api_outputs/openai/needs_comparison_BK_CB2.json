    "FY2024": "FY2024 emphasized citywide priorities (notably affordable housing, public safety, and parks), included a DCP director letter framing transparency and agency responses, and described the CD Needs online submission process (July–November 2022).",
    "FY2025": "FY2025 retained the CD Needs structure and increased emphasis on local public engagement (8 public meetings and the 2nd Annual District Priorities Public Survey), with standard report framing and fewer high-level agency framing statements.",
    "FY2026": "FY2026 continued the same report structure, further institutionalized public participation (8 meetings, 3rd Annual District Priorities Public Survey), and updated neighborhood data/examples while showing small formatting/Contact changes."

  "narrative_comparison": {
    "policy_changes": "Across the three years, explicit policy priority framing shifted from a citywide priorities statement in FY2024 to a more locally procedural emphasis in FY2025 and FY2026. In FY2024 the DCP director wrote that \"community boards again selected affordable housing as the most pressing issue citywide, followed by crime and public safety, and parks and open space,\" which foregrounds specific policy priorities. By contrast, the FY2025 document omits that citywide list and instead documents process and engagement: \"In preparation for the FY25 CD Needs Statement, the District Office conducted 8 public meetings between June - October to discuss District needs by Committee topic area.\" FY2026 continues the engagement focus but does not re-state the FY2024 citywide priority list; instead it describes similar outreach and survey work: \"In preparation for the FY26 CD Needs Statement, the District Office conducted 8 public meetings between June - October..., conducted the 3rd Annual District Priorities Public Survey, and a final internal Board prioritization poll.\"\n\nPolicy attention also shifted in the district-level narrative details: all three years discuss development and demographic change, but the illustrative data/examples changed. FY2025 highlighted a stark local income contrast with specific figures: \"a median household income of $290,403 on the north side of York Street toward Vinegar Hill, versus $26,543 across the street bordering the Farragut NYCHA complex.\" FY2026 retained the example but with different numbers: \"Census Tract 21: $232,302 MHI Census Tract 23: $19,060 MHI,\" indicating an editorial update in the district's data examples and signaling continued emphasis on local economic disparity rather than introducing new overarching policy priorities.",
    "agency_response_evolution": "Agency framing and explicit agency-response messaging was strongest in FY2024 and became more neutral/administrative in FY2025–FY2026. In FY2024 the DCP director explicitly framed agency interaction and transparency: \"...community boards generated more than 3,700 budget requests, and for each, one of 28 City agencies responded to indicate whether the request could be accommodated within the upcoming annual budget. This year, in line with our commitment to increasing transparency across the CD Needs process, we are publishing agency responses to these requests in the final section of these reports.\" That language both quantifies and foregrounds agency responses and DCP support: \"DCP deeply values our partnership with community boards. We remain committed to supporting them...\"\n\nBy FY2025 and FY2026 the reports drop the director letter and the prominent agency-response framing. FY2025 uses neutral process language: \"This report represents the Statement of Community District Needs and Community Board Budget Requests for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025... collected through an online form available to community boards from June to November, 2023.\" FY2026 mirrors that neutral administrative framing (with updated dates): \"This report represents the Statement of Community District Needs and Community Board Budget Requests for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026... collected through an online form available to community boards from June to November, 2024.\" The absence of a comparable director letter or the numeric agency-response statement in FY2025 and FY2026 suggests a shift from an explicitly advocacy/partnership tone in FY2024 toward a steadier, procedural presentation of the CD Needs process in later years.",
    "emphasis_shifts": "Public engagement and formalized surveying grew stronger from FY2024 to FY2026. FY2024's introduction promised procedural improvements and earlier openings of the form: \"we are excited to work with them to continue improving our online submission form, to connect boards with agencies to advance budget request proposals, and to open the form earlier in the calendar year...\" FY2025 then documents that engagement in practice: \"The results of these public meetings were included in the 2nd Annual District Priorities Public Survey, followed by a Board prioritization poll.\" FY2026 shows the continuation and institutionalization of that process: \"...conducted the 3rd Annual District Priorities Public Survey, and a final internal Board prioritization poll.\" This indicates an increasing emphasis on iterative public surveys and internal prioritization.\n\nBy contrast, the explicit citywide policy callouts that appeared in FY2024 (e.g., naming \"affordable housing... crime and public safety, and parks and open space\" as top issues) are not repeated as such in FY2025 or FY2026 introductions. Instead, later years emphasize district-level conditions and updated data examples (e.g., the York Street income contrasts), which signals a shift from broad citywide priority statements toward locally grounded data and process-focused reporting. Additionally, FY2026 adds slightly different and more specific neighborhood framing (for example, repeated and slightly reworded neighborhood lists and updated municipal/infrastructure counts), showing steady thematic continuity (housing, development, equity) but shifting emphasis toward local metrics and sustained community engagement.",
    "structural_changes": "Across the three reports the overall structure (Intro, Census Data, Overview, Top Three Pressing Issues, Policy Areas, Budget Requests, Agency Responses) remains consistent, but presentation and ancillary elements changed. FY2024 includes a signed letter from DCP Director Daniel Garodnick and a publication date of February 2023, opening with a policy-forward tone: \"Letter from DCP Director Daniel Garodnick... To my fellow New Yorkers:\" FY2025 (November 2023) and FY2026 (November 2024) omit that director letter and present a more administrative intro. The availability window for the online form shifts slightly: FY2024 cites collection \"from July to November, 2022,\" while FY2025 and FY2026 both note collection \"from June to November\" in their respective years. FY2026 also shows minor formatting artifacts and different contact details (e.g., FY2026 lists District email as \"bk02@cb.nyc.gov\" whereas earlier reports list CDNEEDS_DL@planning.nyc.gov), and FY2026 contains typographic irregularities in section headers (e.g., \"UV Overarching...\"), suggesting small editorial/format changes over time."

      "significance": "This quote signals the continuation and maturation of the public-survey and internal prioritization process (now in its 3rd year), illustrating a shift toward repeatable, process-oriented community input compared with FY2024's more policy-led framing."
    }
  ],
  "final_interpretation": "Over three years the BK2 CD Needs reports moved from a FY2024 framing that emphasized citywide policy priorities and an explicit DCP partnership/agency-response narrative to FY2025–FY2026 documents that foreground procedural consistency and increasingly institutionalized public engagement (2nd and 3rd Annual surveys). The big story is a shift from high-level policy signaling and agency-focused transparency in FY2024 toward iterative, locally grounded data and formalized community participation by FY2026."
