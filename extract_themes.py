COMPARISON DATA:
{json.dumps(data, indent=2)}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify 4-6 major policy themes that appear across FY2024, FY2025, and FY2026
2. For each theme, assign a "depth score" (0-5) for each fiscal year based on:
   - 0 = Not mentioned at all
   - 1 = Basic mention only
   - 2 = Mentioned with examples
   - 3 = Policy asks or commitments requested
   - 4 = Data/evidence cited
   - 5 = Structured recommendations or frameworks proposed

3. Provide a SHORT label for each theme (2-4 words max)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Extract themes from the actual narrative text, NOT from generic categories
- If a theme is mentioned in summary_table or notable_quotes but not in narratives, still count it
- Score based on the depth of discussion in policy_changes and emphasis_shifts
- Look for themes that EVOLVED across years (e.g., "Traffic" → "Transportation & Mobility" → "Vision Zero")
